//! # Crossteaser Game Module
//!
//! The following definition is from this great website [1]: Crossteaser is a
//! puzzle which consists of a transparent frame enclosing 8 identical coloured
//! pieces arranged as if in a 3 by 3 grid. These pieces are three dimensional
//! crosses, each with six perpendicular arms of different colors. The frame
//! has three vertical slots at the front and three horizontal slots at the back
//! through which the front and back arms of the pieces stick. There is one
//! space in the 3 by 3 grid, and any adjacent piece can be moved into the
//! vacant space, but the slots in the frame force a piece to roll over as it
//! moves. By rolling the pieces around they get mixed up. The aim is to arrange
//! them so that the space is in the middle and that the crosses all have
//! matching orientation.

/* GAME IMPLEMENTATION */

/// Encodes the state of a piece in the game board. For reference, a cube has
/// six faces (up, down, etc.), and a cube with face A on top can be oriented
/// in one of four ways (north, south, etc.).

/// piece is cube-like, it is not enough to just have a face, since a cube with
