/// Specifies the type of data being stored within a record within a specific
/// contiguous subset of bits. This is used for interpretation. Here is the
/// meaning of each variant, with its possible sizes in bits:
/// - `BOOL`: Boolean of size exactly 1.
/// - `ENUM`: Enumeration of arbitrary size.
/// - `UINT`: Unsigned integer of arbitrary size.
/// - `SINT`: Signed integer of size greater than 1.
/// - `SPFP`: Single-precision floating point per IEEE 754 of size exactly 32.
/// - `DPFP`: Double-precision floating point per IEEE 754 of size exactly 64.
/// - `CSTR`: C-style string (ASCII character array) of a size divisible by 8.

/// requires custom handling of what happens when the database is closed; if it
/// has data on memory, then it should persist any dirty pages to ensure
/// consistency. In terms of file structure, each implementation decides how to
/// organize its persistent content. The only overarching requisite is that it
/// be provided an existing directory's path.

/// tables. Because of this application's requirements, this does not mean that
/// a database should be optimized for inter-table operations. In fact, this
/// interface's semantics are such that its implementations optimize performance
/// for cases of sequential operations on a single table.
