//! # Vector Database
//!
//! This module contains a very simple implementation of a persistent key-value
//! store. It works by indexing into an allocated vector through keys, always
//! making sure that it is large enough to house the record with the highest
//! key. This means that its top capacity is the amount of memory that can be
//! allocated by the operating system, without considering the usage of virtual
//! memory.
//!
//! For persistence, a file is created containing a bit-accurate representation
//! of the in-memory vector. Table logic is handled by switching which of these
//! files is currently being targeted, with the understanding that the contents
//! of memory may be materialized on arbitrary operations.
