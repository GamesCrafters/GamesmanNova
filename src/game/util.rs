/// Minimally encodes turn information into the 64-bit integer `state` by
/// shifting the integer in `state` just enough bits to allow `turn` to be
/// expressed, where `turn` is upper-bounded by `player_count`.
///
/// For example, if `player_count` is 3, `state` is `0b00...01`, and we want to
/// encode that it is player `2`'s turn (where players are 0-indexed), we would
/// return `0b00...00111`, whereas if `player_count` was 2 we would return
/// `0b00...0011`. This is because you need two bits to enumerate `{0, 1, 2}`,
