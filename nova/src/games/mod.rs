//! # Game Implementations Module
//!
//! The `games` crate includes implementations for games intended to be
//! solved. To be able to solve a game with GamesmanNova, it must satisfy
//! the following characteristics/constraints:
//!
//! * It must have a finite amount of possible states and moves
//! * No probability must be involved in state transitions
//! * It must be reasonably "sized" (in terms of number of unique states)
//!
//! This module includes functional constructs for economic games and for
//! automata that can be used to traverse them. Additionally, it provides
//! interfaces for solving different kinds of games, such as puzzles.

///
/// ## Explanation
///
/// The motivation behind introducing this is the fundamental overlap between
/// the behavior of puzzles and games. The notion of an NFA allows for a formal
/// grappling with these similarities, as automata theory is quite well
/// established. If you do not know what this is, please see
/// [the NFA wikipedia page](https://tinyurl.com/4vxdkvzh) for more information.
///
/// ### Game Automata
///
/// For deterministic finite games, the final (or "accepting") state set _F_ of
/// an automaton _M_ modeling its behavior would be all of the end states (e.g.,
/// a board of tic-tac-toe with no more empty slots). Then, the formal language
/// _L(M)_ recognized by this automaton would contain all valid sequences of
/// moves leading from the start state of the game to a final state in _F_, with
/// the understanding that a finite alphabet is formed by all possible moves in
/// the game.
///
/// ### Puzzle Automata
///
/// In the case of puzzle automata, the final state set _F_ is similarly the set
/// of states where the puzzle is considered solved, and the language recognized
/// by them is the set of all combinations of transformations that can be
/// applied to the puzzle which bring it from the start state to a member of
/// _F_. Again, this is with the understanding that the amount of
/// transformations that can be applied to any satate of the puzzle is finite.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Consider a puzzle P which consists of removing elements from a set E one at
/// a time until there are no more elements. Then, we can define _M_ an NFA to
/// model P in the following manner:
///
/// - **S** `:= Unsigned Integer`, as sets can only have sizes in [0, _inf_).
/// - The set of states of _M_ is `{|E|, |E| - 1, ..., 0}`, which are all
///   intermediary sizes of E during the existence of the puzzle.
/// - The set of final (or accepting) states of _M_ is `{0}`, which contains the
///   size of the empty set.
/// - _M_'s recognized language _L(M)_ is the set containing only the sequence
///   `{1, 1, 1, ..., 1}` of length _|E|_, as you can only remove one element at
///   any given state, and there are _|E|_ states.
///
/// Note that _|L(M)|_ = 1 implies that there is only one way to solve this
/// puzzle. If _|L(M)|_ were equal to 0, that would imply the puzzle cannot be
/// solved.
